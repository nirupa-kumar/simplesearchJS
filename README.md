# simplesearchJS
Simple search to generate a list of doctors based on User input. 
Problem Statement:
A	site	contains	a	listing	of	doctors.	Users	can	browse	for	doctors	given	a	specific	specialty,	area,	
review	score	etc.	Write	a	function	which	when	given	a	doctor,	provides	a	list	of	similar	doctors,	
in	a	prioritized	order.	You	define	what	similar	means	and	the	result	ordering,	but	clearly	
document	any	assumptions	in	your	code.	You	can	assume	the	entire	directory	of	doctors	fits	
into	memory,	and	write	in	JavaScript.	Include unit tests. 
Aim	to	spend	a	maximum	of	45	minutes	on	this	coding	challenge.	If	applicable,	note	down	any	
remaining	thoughts	or	things	you	would	want	to	improve	on	with	more	time.
